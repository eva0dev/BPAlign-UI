# BPAlign

**BPAlign** is a web-based tool for predicting **hypertension risk** using patient data.  
It connects benchmark datasets with real-world telemedicine records to support both **clinical decision-making** and **research**.

## How It Works
- **Input:** Patient details such as age, gender, smoking status, blood pressure, glucose level, and other basic health measurements.  
- **Output:**  
  - Predicted **hypertension risk score** using models trained on the **Framingham dataset**.  
  - Reports and analyses to evaluate the reliability of the prediction system.

## Key Features
- **Data Quality Assessment** – checks and highlights missing or inconsistent data.  
- **Feature Importance** – shows which variables most strongly influence predictions.  
- **Model Reports** – detailed performance summaries for each model.  
- **Disagreement Case Analysis** – identifies cases where models give conflicting outputs.  
- **ROC Comparison** – visualizes model accuracy across multiple predictors.

Together, these modules produce not only an **ensemble risk prediction** but also an assessment of the **robustness and soundness** of the decision-making process.

## Purpose
BPAlign helps:
- **Clinicians** evaluate hypertension risk during telemedicine visits.  
- **Researchers** explore model performance and data-driven insights in real-world healthcare datasets.

## Usage
This code is part of **ongoing research**.  
If you use or adapt BPAlign, **please contact the author before reuse**.
